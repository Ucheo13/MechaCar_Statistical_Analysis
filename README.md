# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview 
AutosRUsâ€™ upper management has called on us and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

We need to:
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The variables that provided a non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset were vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD. The slope of this is not zero because there are variables that have dependence. This effectively predicts mpg of Mechacar because the rsquared shows it is suffiently correlated.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
The total summary does not meet this design specification. The standard deviation is much too high. Lot one and two meet the specifications while Lot 3 does not as well. 

## T-test on Suspension Coils
Summary of Lot 1 shows that the t test is insufficient and does not pass
Summary of Lot 2 shows that the t test is insufficient and does not pass
Summary of Lot 3 shows that the t test is sufficient and passes
